## Technical Stack

### Front End Dependencies

#### React with Next.js 
Next JS is a universal framework used to enable server side rendering and routing.   [view dependency](https://nextjs.org/)

Next.js will serve each file in /pages under a pathname matching the filename. For example, /pages/about.js is served at site.com/about.

```
import Link from 'next/link'
export default () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello Next.js ðŸ‘‹</h1>
    <Link href='/about'><a>About</a></Link>
  </div>
)
```

#### React apollo
We used react-apollo to query the database using Apollo Client.  Apollo client is designed to help you quickly build a UI that fetches data with GraphQL, and can be used with any JavaScript front-end.  [view dependency](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)

#### Datepicker
In order to select a date for quiz assignment, we used react-datepicker [view dependency](https://reactdatepicker.com/)

#### Rebass/emotion 
Rebass is a collection of pre-built, consistently styled components.  We relied partially on this system to style the application. [view dependency](https://rebassjs.org/)

#### Styled-system/design-system
We essentially built our own reusable theme and styled components that were accessible throughout the app.  You can read more about this paradigm here:  [view dependency](https://varun.ca/styled-system/) 


### Back End Dependencies

#### Hasura   
Our application is powere by Hasura.  Hasura is an open-source engine with a realtime GraphQL API built on a Postgres database, with built-in support for stitching custom GraphQL APIs and triggering web hooks on database changes. | [view dependency](https://hasura.io/)

#### Auth0
auth0 is used to register and authenticate users | [view dependency](https://auth0.com/)

#### Micro
external APIâ€™s are supported with Micro which allows compartmentalization of features.  | [view dependency](https://github.com/zeit/micro)

#### Stripe
a powerful, simple, and seamless payment system that enables teachers to manage payments or upgrade to the pro plan. | [view dependency](https://stripe.com/docs/)

#### Sendgrid
SendGrid supports the distribution of quizzes to students.  In combination with DatePicker, a teacher can select a date from a dropdown.  This triggers an email to students. | [view dependency](  https://sendgrid.com/docs/)

### Using the Back End API

#### Auth Token Payload
The JWT from auth0 is configured with the custom rule:

```
function (user, context, callback) {  
    const namespace = "https://hasura.io/jwt/claims";
    const roles = ['user'];   
    context.idToken[namespace] =     
        {       
            'x-hasura-default-role': 'user',      
             'x-hasura-allowed-roles': roles,      
             'x-hasura-user-id': user.user_id,       
             'x-hasura-user-email': user.email ? user.email : "",       
             'x-hasura-user-first-name': user.given_name ? user.given_name : "",       
             'x-hasura-user-last-name': user.family_name ? user.family_name : ""        
        };   
    callback(null, user, context); }
```
Hasura will use the x-hasura-user-id for permission checks.

#### Requesting Data

Hasura is using GraphQL and as such all requests are a POST request with a GraphQL command string describing the shape of the data being requested or modified.

Therefore the request:
```
query GET_TEACHER{
    teacher{
        id
        email
    }
}
```
will respond with a data object containing a teacher array of objects with id and email of every teacher the requester has permission to view. In the case of a normal user, Hasura is configured
to only return fields where the id is equal to the x-hasura-user-id in the provided JWT token. So it would look like:
```
{
    "data": {
        "teacher": [
            {
                "id": <current teacher id>
                "email": "current_teacher@email.com"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
Data related to each other via one-to-many or many-to-many relationships can be queried together based on named relations. For example the request:
```
query GET_QUIZ($quiz_id: Int!){
    quiz(where: {id: {_eq: $quiz_id}}){
        id
        name
        description
        major_questions{
            id
            prompt
            answers{
                id
                response
                correct_answer
            }
            minor_questions{
                id
                prompt
                answers{
                    id
                    response
                    correct_answer
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
Will query for a quiz where the id matches the passed in quiz_id. The returning data object will contain a quiz array with the matching quiz object. The quiz object will have a sub array for major_questions containing all the major questions related to the current quiz based off the quiz->major_question table one-to-many relationship. Each object in the major question array will also have a sub array named answers containing the major question's related major_answers, and so on for minor questions
